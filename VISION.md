# Vision

> **Note:** This is an outline and work in progress.

---

## 1. The Journaling Problem

- Most people want to reflect but don't
- The blank page is the enemy
- Kodak's solution: just answer when it asks

## 2. What We Noticed

- Patterns emerge that surprise people
- "I didn't realize I kept coming back to that"
- The bot catches things you don't catch yourself

## 3. The Question That Raised

- Is conversation a better way to surface values than asking directly?
- A hypothesis, not a proven claim

## 4. Why We Think It Might Be

- Known problems with questionnaires (aspirational answers, introspective limits, gaming)
- Conversation over time captures behavior, not just beliefs
- Inconsistency detection reveals gaps between words and actions
- Honesty—pushing back—might be what makes it work

## 5. What Becomes Possible (If We're Right)

- Portable values data you own
- Meaningful comparison with others
- The OkCupid example: what values matching looked like, why it failed, what could be different
- Finding others in "values space"—eventually, maybe

## 6. What This Isn't

- Not a dating app
- Not a personality test
- Not telling you who you are
- A tool that pays attention; you decide what to do with it
