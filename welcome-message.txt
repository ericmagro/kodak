Welcome to Kodak

Kodak is a reflective journaling companion. Each day at a time you choose, it checks in with a thoughtful prompt. Through conversation, it helps you explore what's on your mind — and over time, surfaces patterns in what you value.

How it works:
1. DM @Kodak to get started (it'll ask a few setup questions)
2. Pick a daily check-in time (evenings work well for most)
3. When prompted, just chat naturally about your day
4. Kodak extracts beliefs and maps them to your core values

Your values are derived using Schwartz's 10 Basic Human Values — a research-backed framework for understanding what drives people. Over weeks and months, you'll see how your priorities shift.

Key commands:
- /journal — Start a session right now
- /schedule — Change your check-in time
- /values — See your value profile
- /map — See your beliefs by topic
- /share-values — Export to compare with others
- /help — See all commands

Sessions adapt to you. Share a lot and Kodak will explore deeper. Keep it brief and it wraps up quickly.

Kodak is designed to be a genuine companion, not a sycophant. It'll engage honestly, notice contradictions, and sometimes disagree. That's intentional.
