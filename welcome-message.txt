Welcome to Kodak 📸

Kodak is a bot that maps your beliefs through conversation. Just chat naturally, and it builds a picture of what you think and why — your assumptions, values, and how ideas connect.

Kodak is designed to be warm but honest — it'll ask real questions and point out contradictions. Think of it like a curious friend who actually engages with your ideas, not a yes-man.

**Run your own Kodak:**

The bot runs locally on your computer. Your data stays completely private — it never leaves your machine.

👉 **Get started:** https://github.com/ericmagro/kodak

You'll need:
• Python 3.12+
• A Discord bot token (free)
• An Anthropic API key (~$0.01-0.02 per message)

Full setup guide is in the repo. Takes about 10 minutes.

**Commands (once running):**
• `/map` — See your belief map
• `/beliefs` — Raw list of everything captured
• `/pause` — Stop tracking (keep chatting)
• `/export` — Download your data
• `/clear` — Delete everything

**Questions or issues?** Ask in #general or open an issue on GitHub.
