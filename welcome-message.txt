Welcome to Kodak 📸

Kodak is a reflective journaling companion. Each day at a time you choose, it checks in with a thoughtful prompt. Through conversation, it helps you explore what's on your mind — and over time, surfaces patterns in what you value.

Kodak is designed to be warm but honest — it'll ask real questions and point out contradictions. Think of it like a curious friend who actually engages with your ideas, not a yes-man.

Get started:
1. Click on @Kodak in the member list (right sidebar)
2. Click "Message" to start a DM
3. Kodak will walk you through a quick setup (personality + check-in time)
4. Then just chat naturally!

Your values are derived using Schwartz's 10 Basic Human Values — a research-backed framework for understanding what drives people. Over weeks and months, you'll see how your priorities shift.

Key commands:
• /journal — Start a session right now
• /schedule — Change your check-in time
• /values — See your value profile
• /map — See your beliefs by topic
• /share-values — Export to compare with others
• /help — See all commands

Sessions adapt to you. Share a lot and Kodak will explore deeper. Keep it brief and it wraps up quickly.

All your data stays on your device. Use /export anytime to download everything.
