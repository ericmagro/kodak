Welcome to Kodak 📸

Kodak is a bot that maps your beliefs through conversation. Just chat naturally, and it builds a picture of what you think and why — your assumptions, values, and how ideas connect.

Kodak is designed to be warm but honest — it'll ask real questions and point out contradictions. Think of it like a curious friend who actually engages with your ideas, not a yes-man.

**Try it out:**
1. Click on @Kodak in the member list (right sidebar)
2. Click "Message" to start a DM
3. Just talk! It'll ask follow-up questions and start mapping

**Commands:**
• `/map` — See your belief map
• `/beliefs` — Raw list of everything captured
• `/pause` — Stop tracking (keep chatting)
• `/export` — Download your data
• `/clear` — Delete everything

**Heads up:**
• Each message costs real money (API fees), so have good conversations but don't spam 😅
• Data may reset occasionally (server restarts). Use `/export` to save your beliefs.

**Want persistent data?** Run your own instance locally — your data never leaves your machine:
