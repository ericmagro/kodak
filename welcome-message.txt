Welcome to Kodak 📸

Kodak is a bot that maps your beliefs through conversation. Just chat naturally, and it builds a picture of what you think and why — your assumptions, values, and how ideas connect.

Kodak is designed to be warm but honest — it'll ask real questions and point out contradictions. Think of it like a curious friend who actually engages with your ideas, not a yes-man.

**Try it out:**
1. Click on @Kodak in the member list (right sidebar)
2. Click "Message" to start a DM
3. Just talk! It'll ask follow-up questions and start mapping

**Commands:**
• `/map` — See your belief map
• `/beliefs` — Raw list with importance (★) and confidence (●)
• `/mark [id] [1-5]` — Set how important a belief is
• `/core` — Show only your most important beliefs
• `/share` — Create shareable snapshot to post in channels
• `/pause` — Stop tracking (keep chatting)
• `/export` — Download your data
• `/help` — See all commands (there are more!)

**Coming soon:**
• Compatibility matching — find people with similar (or interestingly different) beliefs
• Web visualization — explore your belief map visually
• Obsidian/Roam export — take your beliefs into your notes app

**Heads up:**
• 15 messages per hour limit (API costs add up!)
• Data may reset occasionally (server restarts). Use `/export` to save your beliefs.

**Want persistent data?** Run your own instance locally — your data never leaves your machine:
